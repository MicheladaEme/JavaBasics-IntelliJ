Inheritance in java:
    This is mechanism in java through which one class can acquire the properties
    and methods from another class. The class from which we acquire the properties
    parent/superclass/baseclass and the class which acquire the properties and methods
    child class/ derived class/ subclass.
Advantages:
    1) Code duplication is reduced.
    2) Saves Memory
    3) executions time is less
Disadvantages:
    Classes get tightly coupled. If we change some in the parent class it will affect all the
    children classes and we have to make sure that this new change is compatible with the code
    that we have in the children classes
