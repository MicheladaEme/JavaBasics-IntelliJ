Types of variables:
There are three types of variables local, instance and static
Pros:
Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons:
Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory
than instance variables.
Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are  keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable,
method or a class etc. can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords
1)private 2)protected 3)public
Types of access are 4
1)private 2)default (applied when no keyword is used) 3)protected 4)public

private access(keyword is private):

when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these
can only be accessed within that class.
default access(applied when we don't use any keyword):

when we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to
those variables methods or classes etc. which means these things can only be accessed
from the same package.

protected access(we use the protected class):
when protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.) can be accessed
from other packages but only in the classed that participate in inheritance.

public access(public keyword):
