Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
    1)single
    2)Hierarchical
    3)multilevel
    4)multiple(not supported in java)
single inheritance:
    In single inheritance we have only once child and one parent class. or only two classes
    participate in inheritance one as child one as parent
class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}
Hierarchical:
    In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes.
class Parent{

}
class Child1 extends Parent{

}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}
Multilevel:
We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
class C will be inherited from B and b will be inherited from A.
class A{

}
class B extend A{

}
class C extend B{

}
================================================================
super keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can
access the fields method or constructors of parent inside the child class using this
keyword.
