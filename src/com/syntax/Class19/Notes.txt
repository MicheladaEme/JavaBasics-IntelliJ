Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allows us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods,
constructors etc.) and classes itself in java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we used to define these
 access level fourth level is applier when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
 levels from most restricted to less restricted are
 1)private (keyword is also private)
 2)default (no keyword means default access level)
 3)protected (keyword is also protected)
 4)public (keyword is also public)
 Rules:
 We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data
 and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks
